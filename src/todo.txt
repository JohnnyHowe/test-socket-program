Ports must be different
if making ports fails, show error message
if packet isn't legit, say in terminal and continue
if outgoing text is longer than 255 bytes, don't do it

ip addr checks
if response not legit, print error and exit
client prints complete contents of response packet then exits
find len of bytearray, not text message (not necceasrily equal)

Return sockets to OS
